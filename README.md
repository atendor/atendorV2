üöÄ Getting Started

1. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-org/atendor-design-system.git
cd atendor-design-system
npm install

2. Start the development server

npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

3. Development

All UI code lives in the `components/` directory.

All styling uses Tailwind CSS configured for a 4px grid and Atendor color tokens (see `tailwind.config.js` and `styles/`).

The main font is Geist, loaded via Google Fonts in the application.

Lucide icons are imported via npm and used in components with optional hover animation.

Each component is accessible (ARIA roles, keyboard, focus ring).

All mock data is used for demo purposes only. Where real data/API integration is needed, you‚Äôll see clear TODOs and code comments.

For future backend, set up your API URL in .env.local based on the sample .env.example file:

N8N_API_URL=https://your-api-url-here

üß© Base Components Checklist



Components not available in Reactbits are composed with existing primitives and placeholder logic.


üîÆ Future Custom Modules

Placeholder folders (e.g., `builder/`) are scaffolded for upcoming modules like Visual Builder and AI integrations.

README files indicate where to add custom modules and API logic.

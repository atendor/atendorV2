üöÄ Getting Started

1. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-org/atendor-design-system.git
cd atendor-design-system
npm install

2. Run Storybook

npm run storybook

This opens the Storybook UI documentation at http://localhost:6006.

3. Development

All UI code lives in /src/components and is documented in Storybook.

All styling uses Tailwind CSS configured for a 4px grid and Atendor color tokens (see /src/theme/).

The main font is Geist, loaded via Google Fonts in /public/index.html or the appropriate Next.js file.

Lucide icons are imported via npm and composed in /src/icons/ with hover animation (scale/color).

Each component is accessible (ARIA roles, keyboard, focus ring).

All mock data is used for demo purposes only. Where real data/API integration is needed, you‚Äôll see clear TODOs and code comments.

For future backend, set up your API URL in .env.local based on the sample .env.example file:

N8N_API_URL=https://your-api-url-here

üß© Base Components Checklist



Components not available in Reactbits are composed with existing primitives and placeholder logic.

üìö Storybook Documentation

All components have Storybook stories with variants, usage, accessibility, and code samples.

Tokens, spacing, color system, animation rules, and typography are fully documented in Storybook and /src/theme/.

Getting Started page in Storybook for setup instructions.

üîÆ Future Custom Modules

Placeholder folders (e.g. /src/builder/) are scaffolded for upcoming modules like Visual Builder, AI integrations, etc.

README and Storybook indicate where to add custom modules and API logic.

üõ†Ô∏è Contributing & Customization

Fork the repo, create a feature branch, open a Pull Request.

Follow the 4px grid and color palette for all custom components.

Use only Lucide icons via npm imports (no raw SVGs).

Run npm run lint before submitting changes.

All code, docs, and comments must be in English.

üîê Environment Variables

.env.example is included:

N8N_API_URL=https://your-n8n-api-url.example

Use .env.local for your local setup. No secrets are committed to the repo.

üöÄ Getting Started

1. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/atendor/atendorV2.git
cd atendorV2
npm install

2. Start the development server

npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

3. Development

All UI code lives in the `components/` directory.


All styling uses Tailwind CSS configured for a 4px grid and the design system color tokens (see /src/theme/).


The main font is Geist, loaded via Google Fonts in the application.

Lucide icons are imported via npm and used in components with optional hover animation.

Each component is accessible (ARIA roles, keyboard, focus ring).

All mock data is used for demo purposes only. Where real data/API integration is needed, you‚Äôll see clear TODOs and code comments.

For future backend, set up your API URL in .env.local based on the sample .env.example file:

N8N_API_URL=https://your-api-url-here

üß© Base Components Checklist

- Button
- Input
- Card

Components not available in Reactbits are composed with existing primitives and placeholder logic.

### Usage Examples

```tsx
import Button from "./components/Button";

export default function Example() {
  return <Button onClick={() => alert("Clicked!")}>Click me</Button>;
}
```

```tsx
import Input from "./components/Input";

export default function Example() {
  return <Input label="Email" placeholder="you@example.com" />;
}
```

```tsx
import Card from "./components/Card";

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <p>Your content here</p>
    </Card>
  );
}
```


üîÆ Future Custom Modules

Placeholder folders (e.g., `builder/`) are scaffolded for upcoming modules like Visual Builder and AI integrations.

README files indicate where to add custom modules and API logic.

üõ†Ô∏è Contributing & Customization

Fork the repo, create a feature branch, open a Pull Request.

Follow the 4px grid and color palette for all custom components.

Use only Lucide icons via npm imports (no raw SVGs).

Run `npm run lint` before submitting changes to check for ESLint errors.

All code, docs, and comments must be in English.

üîê Environment Variables

.env.example is included:

N8N_API_URL=https://your-n8n-api-url.example

Use .env.local for your local setup. No secrets are committed to the repo.
